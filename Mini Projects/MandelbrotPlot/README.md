#MandelbrotPlot
The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which z does not fly out to infinity. To plot the Mandelbrot set, for each pixel in our image, we must run the a loop on the corresponding point on the complex plane, and see whether it escapes to infinity, or orbits around the origin forever.
